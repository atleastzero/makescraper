```

## Getting Started

1. Visit [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) and create a new repository named `makescraper`.
2. Run each command line-by-line in your terminal to set up the project:

    ```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:Make-School-Labs/makescraper.git
    $ cd makescraper
    $ git remote rm origin
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/makescraper.git
    $ git checkout chromedp
    $ go mod download
    ```

3. Open `README.md` in your editor and replace all instances of `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub username to enable the Go Report Card badge.

## Deliverables

_Complete each task in the order they appear. Use [GitHub Task List](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-task-lists) syntax to update the task list._

### Requirements

#### Scraping

- [x] **IMPORTANT**: Complete the Web Scraper Workflow worksheet distributed in class.
- [ ] Create a `struct` to store your data.
- [ ] Refactor the `c.OnHTML` callback on line `16` to use the selector(s) you tested while completing the worksheet.
- [ ] Print the data you scraped to `stdout`.

##### Stretch Challenges

- [ ] Add more fields to your `struct`. Extract multiple data points from the website. Print them to `stdout` in a readable format.

#### Serializing & Saving

- [ ] Serialize the `struct` you created to JSON. Print the JSON to `stdout` to validate it.
- [ ] Write scraped data to a file named `output.json`.
- [ ] **Add, commit, and push to GitHub**.
